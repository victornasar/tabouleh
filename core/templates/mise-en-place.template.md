# Mise en Place: <project name>

<!--
The pre-work audit of a project, done once when Tabouleh is attached and
updated whenever a Ticket touches an area this document doesn't yet cover.
Referenced by every Ticket written for this project afterward — a Ticket's
Approach should be able to say "follows existing convention documented
here" instead of re-discovering it each time.

## Stack

<Languages, frameworks, major libraries, runtime versions, package
manager.>

## Structure

<How the codebase is organized — directory layout and what lives where.
Enough that "where does X belong" has an obvious answer.>

## Conventions

<Naming conventions, code style, patterns the project already uses for
common things (error handling, API responses, state management, etc.) so a
Ticket's Approach can follow them instead of inventing new ones.>

## Test setup

<How to run tests, what's covered vs. not, test framework, how to run a
single test/file, any flaky-test or known-gaps notes.>

## Build / run / deploy commands

<The actual commands: local dev server, build, lint, type-check, deploy.
Exact, copy-pasteable.>

## Risky areas

<Fragile code, areas with little/no test coverage, shared state that's
easy to break, anything a Line Cook should be extra careful editing. This
section directly informs which Tickets need extra scrutiny or a more
conservative approach.>

## Environments

<What environments exist (local/dev/staging/prod or equivalent), how
they're distinguished, and which ones are safe for the agent to interact
with directly vs. which require confirmation per KITCHEN_RULES.md (e.g.
production, any environment with real user data).>

## Existing Kitchen Rules exceptions or additions

<Most projects use core/KITCHEN_RULES.md as-is. If this project has
additional rules beyond the universal set — a stricter gate, an extra
BLOCK — note them here. This document cannot remove or weaken anything in
core/KITCHEN_RULES.md, only add to it.>
