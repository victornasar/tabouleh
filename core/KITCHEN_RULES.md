# Kitchen Rules

These rules apply to every role (Executive Chef, Line Cook, Expediter) on
every project Tabouleh is attached to, regardless of model or tool. They are
not suggestions and not overridable by a Ticket, a user request, or a
Recipe. If a Ticket ever conflicts with these rules, the rules win and the
conflict gets escalated to the human.

Every rule below names a **specific action** and a **specific required
response**. There are three possible responses:

- **CONFIRM** — Stop. Describe exactly what will happen. Get an explicit yes
  from the human before doing it. Proceeding on silence, on an ambiguous
  reply, or on a prior unrelated approval is not permitted.
- **BLOCK** — Do not do this. There is no confirmation that unlocks it. If
  the task seems to require it, stop and explain why, and propose an
  alternative or escalate.
- **ESCALATE** — Stop the current work and hand it back to the human with a
  clear explanation of what was found and why it can't proceed
  automatically. This is different from CONFIRM: escalation means the agent
  doesn't have enough information or authority to even frame a yes/no ask.

## 1. Version control

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git push --force` / `push --force-with-lease` to a shared branch (`main`, `master`, `develop`, any branch others may have pulled) | **BLOCK** | Rewriting shared history is a standing prohibition, not a confirm-gate. If a force-push genuinely seems necessary, escalate — don't ask "can I force-push," explain the situation instead. |
| `git rebase -i` on any branch already pushed / shared | **BLOCK** | Same reasoning as above — interactive rebase on public history rewrites what others may depend on. |
| `git reset --hard` | **CONFIRM** | State exactly what commits/changes will be discarded before running it. |
| Deleting a git branch (local or remote) | **CONFIRM** | Name the branch and confirm it's not the one currently being worked from. |
| `git commit` / `git push` to `main`/`master` directly (no feature branch) | **BLOCK** | Work happens on a branch. If the project has no branch protection, this rule still applies — branch first. |
| Amending or rewriting a commit already pushed to a shared branch | **BLOCK** | Same as force-push — this is history-rewriting on shared state. |
| Creating a new branch, committing to it, pushing a new branch, opening a PR | No confirmation needed | Normal flow — these don't touch existing shared state. |

## 2. Deletion and destructive filesystem ops

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deleting a file or directory that wasn't created during this Ticket's work | **CONFIRM** | Name every path before deleting. |
| Deleting a file or directory that *was* created during this Ticket's work (e.g. cleaning up a scratch file) | No confirmation needed | Still log what was removed in the handoff notes. |
| Emptying trash, permanently deleting (`rm -rf`, force-delete bypassing any recycle/trash mechanism) | **BLOCK** | If a permanent delete is genuinely required, escalate with a specific list of what and why — the human performs the deletion. |
| Overwriting a file without having read its current contents first | **BLOCK** | Applies everywhere, including inside Tabouleh's own repo. Read before write, always. |
| Deleting or rewriting any file under `tabouleh/core/` or `tabouleh/adapters/` (this repo's own rules, roles, or templates) | **CONFIRM** | Tabouleh has no "production," but its core files are load-bearing for every attached project. Treat them with the same discipline as production code. |

## 3. Dependencies and environment

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Adding a new dependency not already listed on the Ticket | **CONFIRM** | Name the package, version, and why it's needed. |
| Removing or downgrading a dependency | **CONFIRM** | State what breaks or changes as a result. |
| Running an installer/package manager in a mode that modifies lockfiles project-wide (e.g. broad `update`/`upgrade` across all packages) | **CONFIRM** | Scoped, single-package installs tied to the Ticket don't need re-confirmation once the dependency itself was confirmed. |
| Modifying CI/CD configuration (workflow files, build pipelines) | **CONFIRM** | These affect every future run, not just this Ticket. |
| Changing environment variables, `.env` files, or secret references | **CONFIRM** | Never print, log, or echo actual secret *values* — see Rule 5. |

## 4. Database and migrations

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Writing a migration | No confirmation needed to *write* it | Follow [`recipe-safe-migration.md`](recipes/recipe-safe-migration.md). |
| Running a migration against any database that is not a local/dev/throwaway instance | **CONFIRM** | State which environment, what the migration does, and whether it's reversible. |
| Running a migration against production or any database holding real user data, under any circumstance | **ESCALATE**, then **CONFIRM** if the human wants to proceed | The agent does not run this itself even after a yes — surface the exact command for the human to run, or confirm explicitly that the agent is authorized to execute it directly. |
| A migration that drops a column, drops a table, or is otherwise not backward-compatible / not easily reversible | **CONFIRM**, with the rollback plan stated explicitly before running | See Rule 7 (rollback discipline). |
| Seeding or modifying data (not schema) in any non-local database | **CONFIRM** | |

## 5. Secrets and credentials

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Entering a password, API key, token, or credential into any field, config, or prompt | **BLOCK** | The agent never handles credential values directly — see the platform's own instruction-source rules for how this is delegated to the human or a credential manager. |
| Committing a file that contains a secret (API key, private key, `.env` with real values) | **BLOCK** | If one is found already committed, escalate immediately — treat it as a live incident, not a routine fix. |
| Printing, logging, or echoing an existing secret value to the terminal, a file, or a chat response | **BLOCK** | Reference secrets by name only (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set`), never by value. |
| Reading a `.env` or secrets file to check *which* keys exist (not their values) | No confirmation needed | |

## 6. Production and anything user-facing at scale

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deploying to a production environment | **CONFIRM** | State what's being deployed and from what commit/branch. |
| Any action described in a Ticket as touching "production," "prod," or a live customer-facing system | **CONFIRM**, minimum | If the action is also destructive or irreversible (Rules 2 or 4), the stricter rule applies. |
| Sending real communications to real users (email blasts, notifications, webhooks to third parties) as part of testing or verification | **BLOCK** | Use test/staging endpoints or mock recipients. If none exist, escalate — don't improvise a workaround that risks hitting real users. |
| Changing feature flags, rollout percentages, or config that affects live traffic | **CONFIRM** | |

## 7. Rollback and checkpoint discipline

These aren't a single action/response pair — they're standing requirements
that apply throughout every Ticket:

- **No Ticket is fired (see [`THE_PASS.md`](THE_PASS.md)) without a clean,
  committed starting state to roll back to.** If the working tree is dirty
  or on a branch with unrelated uncommitted changes, that gets resolved
  first.
- **Every Ticket states a rollback plan before work starts**, not after.
  "Revert the commit" is a valid rollback plan for most changes; migrations
  and anything in Rule 4 need a more specific plan (see
  [`recipe-safe-migration.md`](recipes/recipe-safe-migration.md)).
- **Irreversible actions (Rule 2, Rule 4's non-backward-compatible row, Rule
  6) require the rollback plan to be stated as part of the CONFIRM ask
  itself** — the human is confirming the action *and* the fact that it
  can't be trivially undone, together, not as two separate steps.
- If, mid-Ticket, it becomes clear the rollback plan stated at the start no
  longer covers what's actually being done, that's an **ESCALATE**, not a
  reason to proceed on the original plan.

## 8. Scope and authority boundaries

| Action | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Work that falls outside the current Ticket's stated files/approach ("while I'm in here" fixes, drive-by refactors) | **BLOCK** for the Line Cook | Not this role's call — see [`line-cook.md`](roles/line-cook.md) on scope creep. Note it and let the Executive Chef decide whether it becomes a new Ticket. |
| A Ticket that is ambiguous, internally contradictory, or missing acceptance criteria | **ESCALATE** before firing | Don't guess at intent on anything with the response classes above. |
| The Expediter finding a Kitchen Rules violation in finished work | **ESCALATE** immediately, not a normal send-back | See [`expediter.md`](roles/expediter.md) and [`THE_PASS.md`](THE_PASS.md) loopback policy — rule violations don't go through the normal retry loop. |

## How to read "no confirmation needed"

Anything not listed above, and anything explicitly marked "no confirmation
needed," is regular work: writing code, running local tests, reading files,
creating new files inside the Ticket's stated scope, committing to a
feature branch. The absence of a gate is intentional — requiring
confirmation for everything defeats the point of having an agent do the
work. The gates above exist specifically because these are the actions
where a mistake is expensive, hard to reverse, or affects someone other
than the person who approved the Ticket.
